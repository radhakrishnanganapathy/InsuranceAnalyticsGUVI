What This Project Does?
  This project uses machine learning and data analytics on insurance data (customers, claims, premiums, loans, payments, etc.) to solve 3 real-world problems:
  
  1. Fraud Detection (Classification)
  
    Goal: Find out if an insurance claim is fraudulent or legitimate.
    
    Example: If someone makes a fake accident claim to get money, the model should predict it as fraud.
  
  2. Premium Prediction (Regression)
  
    Goal: Predict the insurance premium amount a customer should pay.
    
    Example: A 23-year-old with 4 loans and delayed payments may have a higher risk, so the model will recommend a higher premium.
  
  3. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
  
    Goal: Group customers into segments based on behavior.
    
    Example:
    
    Group 1: Low income + frequent delayed payments (High Risk)
    
    Group 2: High income + no delayed payments (Safe Customers)
    
    Business can then offer different products/policies for each group.
